# Contributing

This repo holds shadcn-table, a React data table on TanStack Table v9 that ships as a shadcn registry: the source is copied into the user's app by the shadcn CLI, there is no npm package, and the Radix and Base UI bases are supported through one edition each. The library source lives once per base, as two complete trees under `packages/shadcn-table/registry/`: `radix` and `base`, each with its shadcn parts and every library file. A change goes through four pieces:

1. **Library:** `packages/shadcn-table`, the two trees and the shared Storybook stories.
2. **Tests:** Vitest runs every story in headless Chromium, once per base.
3. **Docs:** `apps/shadcn-table-docs`, which holds an installed copy of the library.
4. **Registry:** what users install, one item per base built from that base's tree.

```text
packages/shadcn-table/registry/radix | registry/base
  ▼ stories + vitest (both bases)   (prove the change)
  ▼ registry:build                  (what users install)
  ▼ lib:install <base>              (docs app copies, one per base)
apps/shadcn-table-docs              (docs, examples, page gate)
```

The goal of this guide: make a change, prove it, open a PR. Release steps live in `.ai/plans/release-v0.1/anindosarker/release-v0.1-plan.md`; Vercel and table internals are out of scope here.

## Two Trees

`registry/<base>/components/ui/shadcn-table/` is the library, once per base. Each tree builds on its own shadcn parts (Radix in `radix-ui`, Base UI in `@base-ui/react`); `@/` is a plain alias to the tree, so no adapter layer, no codemod, nothing generated. `scripts/registry/base-diff.json` lists the library files that differ between the trees on purpose; every other library file must be byte-identical in both, and `pnpm check:bases` (the CI job `bases`) fails otherwise. The rule for a library change:

- **Edit both trees** when both editions take the change (the guard reports a missed twin), or
- **edit one tree and add the path to `base-diff.json`** in the same commit when only one base does, and say so in the PR.

`packages/shadcn-table/registry/README.md` has what lives where, how to add a part and the gates.

## Prerequisites

Node 22, pnpm 10.13.1 (pinned by `packageManager`, Corepack picks it up), and Chromium for Playwright (step 1 installs it).

| Port | Server                                                             |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 5320 | docs app (`pnpm --filter shadcn-table-docs dev`)                   |
| 6006 | Storybook, Radix edition (`pnpm storybook`)                        |
| 6007 | Storybook, Base UI edition (`pnpm --filter shadcn-table storybook:base`) |
| 5310 | dev registry (`pnpm registry:dev`)                                 |

Optional environment variables:

| Variable               | Effect                                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PORT`                 | docs dev server port; any value other than 5320 also switches the build dir to `.next-<PORT>` |
| `NEXT_DIST_DIR`        | docs build dir, so two `next dev` or `next build` runs do not share `.next`               |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | absolute site URL in deployments (install snippets, agent prompt); the dev port otherwise |
| `REGISTRY_BASE_URL`    | base URL written into the dev registry instead of `http://localhost:5310/r`              |
| `ST_BASE`              | `base` aliases `@/` to `registry/base` in Vitest and Storybook (the `:base` scripts set it); unset means `registry/radix` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY` | PostHog project key for the docs app; unset means analytics load nothing (see Analytics)   |

## 1. Set Up

Chromium is needed once: the tests and the page gate run in it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anindosarker/shadcn-table.git
cd shadcn-table
pnpm install
pnpm --filter shadcn-table exec playwright install chromium
```

## 2. Change the Library

Edit `packages/shadcn-table/registry/radix/components/ui/shadcn-table` and its twin under `registry/base/components/ui/shadcn-table` (or one tree plus `scripts/registry/base-diff.json` for a base-only change), then add or update a story under `stories/`: the stories are the test suite, so a change without a story is untested. The Radix loop:

```bash
pnpm storybook                          # http://localhost:6006
pnpm test                               # every story, headless Chromium
pnpm --filter shadcn-table tsc:radix
pnpm --filter shadcn-table lint
pnpm check:bases
```

The Base UI loop, the same stories against `registry/base`:

```bash
pnpm --filter shadcn-table storybook:base    # http://localhost:6007
pnpm test:base
pnpm --filter shadcn-table tsc:baseui
```

- **Stories are tests.** `pnpm test` renders each story and fails on a thrown error or a failed `play` function. A behavior change needs a story that exercises it, and the story must pass on both bases. A behavior that differs on purpose gets a `<name>.radix.stories.tsx` or `<name>.base.stories.tsx`, included only on that base.
- **shadcn/ui parts.** `registry/<base>/components/ui/*.tsx` are plain shadcn components; change them only when the table needs it, since users get their own copies. Add or refresh one with `pnpm add-part`, which fetches it in the base's style (`registry/<base>/components.json`) and prints the dependencies to add:

  ```bash
  pnpm add-part base tooltip               # or: pnpm add-part radix tooltip
  ```

- **Props differ per base.** Menu, select, tooltip, checkbox, slider and popover take different props on Base UI (`render` instead of `asChild`, `closeOnClick`, `alignItemWithTrigger`, the `indeterminate` prop, `onValueCommitted`, ...). The files in `base-diff.json` are plain code against those parts; do not port a Radix prop over and expect it to type-check.

## 3. Sync the Docs App

The docs app renders the installed copies in `components/ui-radix` and `components/ui-base`, not the package source, so a library change is invisible there until you reinstall them. Each copy comes from that base's built item; the installer restores `components.json`, `app/global.css`, `package.json` and the lockfile afterwards, so a reinstall of an unchanged library leaves `git status` clean.

```bash
pnpm registry:build
pnpm --filter shadcn-table-docs lib:install radix
pnpm --filter shadcn-table-docs lib:install base
pnpm --filter shadcn-table-docs dev                        # http://localhost:5320
pnpm --filter shadcn-table-docs types:check
```

The example sources under `examples/<slug>/` import `@/components/ui/...`, the path a reader has after `shadcn add`, and that is what the code view shows on every base. The live examples run on generated variants, `examples/.radix/`, `examples/.base/` and `examples/.aria/` (`lib/example-variants.mjs`, written on `predev`, `build` and `pnpm examples:variants`), whose imports point at the installed copies and whose part props are rewritten for the base (Base UI `render` for `asChild`, the React Aria prop names); an example that no rewrite can carry is written in an edition-neutral form.

Page gate, with the dev server running, from `apps/shadcn-table-docs`:

```bash
node scripts/check-pages.mjs a --base http://localhost:5320          # one cluster
node scripts/check-pages.mjs /docs/guides/sorting --base http://localhost:5320   # one page
node scripts/check-pages.mjs --base http://localhost:5320            # everything
```

- **Clusters.** `a` is getting-started and the API pages, `b` and `c` the guides, `d` and `e` the examples; `e` also covers the home page. The gate loads each page at desktop and mobile widths and fails on any console error, in particular hydration mismatches.
- **`tsconfig.json` include noise.** Next.js appends `<distDir>/types/**/*.ts` lines to `apps/shadcn-table-docs/tsconfig.json` on every `dev` and `build`. Keep only the default `.next/...` pair; do not commit the others.
- **Second server.** `PORT=5331 pnpm --filter shadcn-table-docs dev` runs a second docs server next to the default one, with its own build dir.

## 4. Prove the Install

The registry is the product, so a library change is only done once the CLI installs it into an app that type-checks and builds, on each base you changed.

```bash
pnpm registry:dev                       # builds .dev/ and serves it on http://localhost:5310
```

Fresh Radix app, anywhere outside the repo:

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest init --template vite --base radix --preset nova --name my-app
cd my-app
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add http://localhost:5310/r/shadcn-table.json
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add http://localhost:5310/r/shadcn-table-locale-de.json   # optional, one per locale
```

Fresh Base UI app, with the Base UI items:

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest init --template vite --base base --preset nova --name my-base-app
cd my-base-app
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add http://localhost:5310/r/shadcn-table-base.json
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add http://localhost:5310/r/shadcn-table-base-locale-de.json   # optional
```

Mount it in `src/App.tsx`:

```tsx
import { ShadcnTable } from '@/components/ui/shadcn-table';

const columns = [
  { accessorKey: 'name', header: 'Name' },
  { accessorKey: 'age', header: 'Age' },
];
const data = [
  { name: 'Ada', age: 36 },
  { name: 'Linus', age: 54 },
];

export default function App() {
  return <ShadcnTable columns={columns} data={data} />;
}
```

```bash
pnpm exec tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.app.json
pnpm exec vite build
```

- **Existing app.** Repeat in an app that already has `@tanstack/react-table` installed (`pnpm add @tanstack/react-table@8.20.5 @tanstack/react-query` first). The CLI merges the dependency; `package.json` must end with one `@tanstack/react-table` entry.
- **From a pushed branch.** Example items resolve only through GitHub, and the library items can too: `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add anindosarker/shadcn-table/shadcn-table#<branch>` (or `shadcn-table-base#<branch>`), then `anindosarker/shadcn-table/example-basic#<branch> --overwrite`. Set `GH_TOKEN` to avoid the API rate limit. Locale items depend on the unpinned library address, which the CLI resolves on the default branch, so from a branch install them through `registry:dev` (that is what the CI `install` job does).
- **Rerun after changes.** `registry:dev` rebuilds `.dev/`; `add` again with `--overwrite` to update the installed files.

## 5. Update the Docs and the Registry

Docs pages live in `content/docs`; every example is a folder under `examples/` with a `TS.tsx` and, when it has data, a `makeData.ts`.

```bash
pnpm registry:build                     # library items -> packages/shadcn-table/registry.json
pnpm registry:items                     # example items -> apps/shadcn-table-docs/registry.json
pnpm registry:hosted                    # hosted copies -> apps/shadcn-table-docs/public/r/{radix,base}/ (docs build runs it)
```

The registry has two library items, one per base, each with its own locale items; each lists every file of its tree:

| Tree             | Item                | Locales                           | npm dependency   |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `registry/radix` | `shadcn-table`      | `shadcn-table-locale-<code>`      | `radix-ui`       |
| `registry/base`  | `shadcn-table-base` | `shadcn-table-base-locale-<code>` | `@base-ui/react` |

Both list the same 23 shadcn parts as bare `registryDependencies`, so the user's CLI installs its own base's parts. Users install from the hosted registry on the docs site, one path per base with the same item names on both: `https://www.shadcn-table.com/r/radix/shadcn-table.json` and `https://www.shadcn-table.com/r/base/shadcn-table.json` (locales `/r/<base>/shadcn-table-locale-<code>.json`, examples `/r/<base>/example-<slug>.json`), or through the namespace `@st=https://www.shadcn-table.com/r/{style}/{name}.json`. The GitHub addresses (`anindosarker/shadcn-table/<item>`) stay as the fallback.

- **Both `registry.json` files are committed.** `registry:build` and `registry:items` write them with GitHub addresses; never commit one that points at localhost (that is what `registry:dev` and `.dev/` are for). The scripts live in `packages/shadcn-table/scripts/registry/`; the catalogs stay next to the files they list because the CLI resolves `files[].path` relative to the catalog.
- **Example items are base-neutral.** They use the public API only and pin no library item, so one example item serves both bases; the docs say to install the table first. Examples pin shadcn parts to the branch in `lib/shared.ts` (`gitConfig.branch`).
- **Page checks.** A new page that renders live examples or prop tables needs an entry in `scripts/page-checks/<cluster>.mjs`.

## 6. Open a PR

CI runs these, in this order; run them first.

```bash
pnpm --filter shadcn-table tsc:radix
pnpm --filter shadcn-table tsc:baseui
pnpm --filter shadcn-table lint
pnpm check:bases
pnpm --filter shadcn-table storybook:build
pnpm --filter shadcn-table storybook:build:base
pnpm test
pnpm test:base
pnpm --filter shadcn-table-docs types:check
pnpm --filter shadcn-table-docs lint
pnpm --filter shadcn-table-docs build
```

On a push, CI also validates the registry at the pushed SHA, installs the library, a locale and `example-basic` into a fresh Radix Vite app, into one that already has TanStack packages, into a Base UI Vite app with `shadcn-table-base`, and into a Next.js app (the `registry` and `install` jobs).

- **Large changes.** Ask on [Discord](https://discord.gg/hsF37t6EKe) first if unsure, then open a GitHub issue, so the direction is agreed before the diff exists.
- **Format.** `pnpm prettier --write <changed files>` for `ts`, `tsx`, `mjs` and `mdx`; `md` and `json` files are prettier-ignored.
- **Commit messages.** `type: short summary` in the imperative (`fix: keep pinned rows visible in grid mode`), one concern per commit.
- **Stage explicit paths.** No `git add -A`: generated files, `.next-*` dirs and `tsconfig.json` noise slip in otherwise.

## Analytics

The docs app reports to PostHog (US cloud); the library is untouched. How it is wired:

1. `apps/shadcn-table-docs/components/posthog-provider.tsx` initialises `posthog-js` once in a `useEffect`, only when `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY` is set, with `api_host: '/ingest'`, page views on history changes, no autocapture and no `identify`; it registers the selected base as a super property, so every report can break down by `base`. Without the key it renders its children and loads nothing.
2. `apps/shadcn-table-docs/app/layout.tsx` mounts it inside fumadocs' `RootProvider`.
3. `apps/shadcn-table-docs/next.config.mjs` rewrites `/ingest/static/*` to `us-assets.i.posthog.com` and `/ingest/*` to `us.i.posthog.com`, with `skipTrailingSlashRedirect` because PostHog paths end with a slash. Events leave from the site's own origin, so ad blockers that drop `posthog.com` requests do not drop them.
4. `apps/shadcn-table-docs/lib/analytics.ts` holds one function per event with typed properties: `base_switched`, `install_command_copied`, `example_code_opened`, `example_file_viewed`, `storybook_opened`, `outbound_clicked`, `search_used`. Components call these functions and never `posthog` directly, so renaming an event is a change to that file alone.
5. The key lives in the Vercel project env (Production and Preview) and in a local `.env.local`; it is never committed.

To run with a key locally, put `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY=phc_...` in `apps/shadcn-table-docs/.env.local` (gitignored) and start the dev server or `next build && next start`. The key is public by design: it only lets a browser send events. Without it, the Network tab shows no `/ingest` request and nothing logs. With it, every route change sends a `$pageview` to `/ingest/e/` or `/ingest/batch/`, and each action above sends its event; PostHog's "Activity" page lists them live.

Reading the data in the PostHog UI:

- **Web analytics** (left nav): visitors, page views, top pages, referrers, countries, devices. The daily glance.
- **Product analytics, Trends:** pick an event, for example `install_command_copied`, break down by `base` and `package_manager`. Save it as an insight and pin it to a dashboard named "shadcn-table".
- **Funnels:** `$pageview` filtered to an example page, then `example_code_opened`, then `install_command_copied`; a breakdown by `base` shows which base converts.
- **Paths:** start at `$pageview` on the install page to see where readers go next.
- Three insights to create on day one: page views by base, install copies by base and package manager, the example-to-install funnel.

Session replay, surveys, feature flags and error tracking are not enabled. There is no cookie banner: `person_profiles: 'identified_only'` without `identify` stores an anonymous id only; revisit if an EU audience grows.

## Common Mistakes

- **Editing the docs copy.** `apps/shadcn-table-docs/components/ui-radix` and `components/ui-base` are overwritten by `lib:install <base>`. Change `packages/shadcn-table/registry/<base>` and sync.
- **Editing one tree only.** The other edition keeps the old code; `pnpm check:bases` red is the sign, as is `pnpm test` green and `pnpm test:base` red (or the reverse). Make the change in the other tree too, or add the path to `base-diff.json` when the difference is meant.
- **Forgetting `lib:install <base>`.** The docs app, the page gate and the examples keep running on the old library on that base.
- **Committing `tsconfig.json` include noise.** Only the two `.next/...` lines belong there.
- **`registry.json` rewritten with localhost.** Use `pnpm registry:dev`, which writes to the gitignored `.dev/`.
- **A port already in use.** Pick another with `PORT=` (docs), `storybook dev -p` (Storybook) or `REGISTRY_BASE_URL` plus your own `serve` (registry).
- **The item and the base do not match.** `shadcn init` defaults to Base UI; that project needs the `/r/base/` path (`shadcn-table-base` on GitHub), a `--base radix` project the `/r/radix/` path (`shadcn-table`). The wrong edition does not type-check. React Aria is not supported.
